            <h2 class="display-4">Kirstenbosch botanical garden</h2>
            <p>To start the ascent, we started from the botanical garden of Kirstenbosch. This garden is reputed to be one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world.<br>
              It's important to say that I've visited this park in summer so, if you have to do that in summer to, make sure that you have enought whater and a hat.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p> Located on the eastern side of the Table Montain, this 528 hectare garden was created in 1913 by Professor Pearson.<br>
        Buried in the garden at his death in 1916, his epitaph is "if you are looking for his monument, look around you".<br>
        When I've visited this garden at the morning the weather was cloudy but the weather in South Africa is very uncertain and the rest of the day was very sunny.<br>
        We say that in South Africa, we can have the forth seasons in one day !<br>
        After walking during one hour in between the beautiful flowers and threes of the park, I've found a place where a bridge overlooks the rest of the park.<br>
        This cursive bridge is realy atractive and some peapole came to take a picture in this beautifull place.

            <h2 class="display-4">The skeletton george</h2>
            <p> 
              After visiting the garden, we went to the george skeletton gorge to start the hike.<br>
              This gorge are situated to the back of the garden and it's possible to access whitout pay for the garden.<br>
              The george are a little bit diffucult to access for the begeners hikers but they are shady so that's perfect for the hot days.<br>
              Unfortunately you will be forced to walk under the sun after the skeletton george, that's will also give you a beautiful view on the city bowl.
